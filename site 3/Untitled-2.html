        <h1>This is the <em>best</em> motherfucking website.</h1>
        <p>Really, it is.</p>
        <h2>Seriously, you guys think that a fucking website doesn't need some styling?</h2>
        You probably build websites using vim and feeling hardcore. You think your 4.99KB <span class='vert'>motherfuckingwebsite(.com) </span>
        is going to get you some fucking award to put on your damn footer as a link. You think your fucking default font is gonna make your website run even on a toaster.
        <p><span id='wrong'>WRONG</span>, motherfucker.</p>
        <h2>The best kick-ass website</h2>
        <p>Let me describe the real perfect-ass website which still has the glory of the past <span class='vert'>motherfuckingwebsites:</span></p>
        <li>Shit doesn't weigh a ton (in fact it's just 34.97 KB when the 27.83KB cat picture below is removed)</li>
        <li>The page weighs exactly 63.02kB, 93.7% less than the <a href="https://google.com/">Google home page</a></li>
        <li>Fits on your iPhone 1st gen (although it doesn't work on your damn 16x32 Tamagotchi)</li>
        <li>Looks <em>almost</em> the same on every screen</li>
        <li>Every asshole that visits this website can use it without any problem <small>well, kind of</small></li>
        <li>It's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">accessible</a>, so everyone can enjoy it <small>but not everyone can read this - this text is Ant-Accessible</small></li>
        <li>Shit is <em>even more</em> legible than the fucking two previous versions - and it also has a cleanish style without looking like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">ARPANET</a> website</li>
        <li>Doesn't load massive images or scripts. We should all care about people who still use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers">IPoAC</a></li>
        <li>Uses only free and open resources. Like this ass-breaking font called "Open Sans" <small>which btw weighs 15.21kB, wtf</small></li>
        <li>It doesn't load your glorious jQuery or jQueryUI with all their fucking styles and shits. Nor Angular or any other framework. This website is made with plain HTML, CSS3 and JS. Keep it Vanilla!</li>
        <li>Doesn't include any tracking service <small>this website does, but hey, who cares</small></li>
        <li>Images aren't forbidden, but when SVG is available <em>JUST USE IT</em>.</li><li>Use <em>some</em> fucking 
        <!-- hum hum hardcore Ã§a -->
        <span class="colored" id="rbw" style="color: rgb(71, 112, 235);">colors</span>.</li>
        <li>Links don't really need to keep that <span class="bleu">shitty blue</span> the browser is giving them: nor that <span class="violet">violetish color</span> when they are marked as visited. Just give them a <a href="http://www.colorhexa.com/0077aa">nice color</a>

        <h2>Well guess what, motherfucker:</h2>
        <p>This website is even better than the last guy and the guy before him.</p>
        <p>Why ?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It uses some cool technologies like JavaScript <img src='JavaScript' title='javascript'> , CSS3 <img src='CSS3' title="css" and HTML5 <img src="HTML5" title="HTML5"></li>
            <li><code>0. You just DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO.</code></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Put even less contrast</h2>
        <p>Yeah, a #444 is cool but a #454545 is better.</p>

        <p> We don't need to break our eyes while looking at a <span class="vert">motherfuckingwebsite.</span></p>

        <h2>Size matters, yeah, but don't exaggerate</h2>

        <p>Remember, not everybody is blind, and not everybody wants to read a fucking 2 inches letter on a 27 inches screen, so keep it cool. Don't exaggerate in size,
         but don't make an ant-compatible text either.</p>

        <h2>Put some pictures</h2>
        <img src="chaton" title="chaton">

        bla bla bla
            
        <button type="button" onclick="document.body.style.backgroundColor='pink'">'click'</button>

    <script>
        setTimeout(alert('wesh lol',100));
    </script>
